# Methocode

welcome to methocode.com (http://methocode.com), started on Hack.Diversity by Team9 with the project Code Switching Literally

Methocode is a place where you can learn a new programming language, just check it out. For now It's still being build but It's growing into a multiuse platform where you can ask questions, troubleshoot problems and check out our programming language courses. The site is open to the public and if you want to learn a new language all you have to do is sign up. Come try it :)
